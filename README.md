# Heart Attack Predictor
## Inspiration
Heart attack is a common cause of death nowadays, not only old people but younger ones have also been victims of this. Although we have specialized doctors in this, yet the doctor to patient ratio is huge making our medical infrastructure inefficient. This is where Machine Learning comes in, our model will predict the chances of heart attack of a person based on various parameters. With an accuracy of **83.51 %** with an precision of **84.31%** .

## What it does
On giving the required parameters our model predicts the possibility of heart attack. We have deployed our model on the internet.

## How we built it
We tried with multiple Machine Learning algorithms like KNN , Logistic Regression , Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifier. Finally we used _Random Forest Classifier Algorithm_ which is a supervised algorithm classification method. In this algorithm, some trees form a forest. All trees in the Random Forest give the expected value of the class, and the class with the most votes is the model prediction. Random forest classifiers are more accurate as the  number of trees increases. The three common methods are: 
Forest RI (random input selection). 
Forest RC (random mix).
Combination of forest RI and forest RC. 

Used for both classification and regression problems, but good for dealing with classification problems and overcoming missing values.

## Challenges we ran into
The biggest challenge was selecting the most precise and accurate algorithm for our model.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are quite proud that our model shows an accuracy of **83.51 %** with an precision of **84.31%** .
And it is very easy to use as it is deployed globally on the internet.

## What's next for Heart Attack Predictor 
We are planning to make it more interactive by integrating with various medical APIs to make the website more useful and to make it a complete website and not only a detector one. We also plan to create a mobile application too.
