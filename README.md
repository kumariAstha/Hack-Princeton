# risk-of-heart-failure-using-machine-learning
Cardiovascular diseases are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worlwide.  

Early detection can be a great way to manage this Risk , and this is where a machine learning model comes in. 

For the purpose of predicting the risk of a heart failure in patients, we used the Logistic Regression Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, KNN classifier and Decision Tree Classifier to build a machine learning model. And we got the best performance from Random Forest Classifier with an accuracy of 83.51% and precision score of 84.31%.`The model is deployed using Flask and Heroku.
